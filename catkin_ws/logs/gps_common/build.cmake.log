CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:54 (add_executable):
  Policy CMP0037 is not set: Target names should not be reserved and should
  match a validity pattern.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0037" for policy
  details.  Use the cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this
  warning.

  The target name "gps_common/utm_odometry_node" is reserved or not valid for
  certain CMake features, such as generator expressions, and may result in
  undefined behavior.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
